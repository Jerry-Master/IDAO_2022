There are installed the following packages, and all of their dependencies:

* Numpy, Pandas, MatPlotLib: The typical packages for data science.
* Tensorflow (CPU): The package for neural network.
* MegNet: The baseline model, it is a Graph Neural Network.
* NglView: The package used for visualizations.
* PyMatGen: The package used for loading the crystal structures.
